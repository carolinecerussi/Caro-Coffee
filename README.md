# Caro Coffee 

### By Caroline Cerussi

## Description:

This application is an inventory tracker for a coffee roaster's business. It has CRUD functionality- allowing the user to create a new type of coffee bean, including a full description with a few different properties. When adding the new type, you are redirected to the home page, where you will see the name of the new coffee bean in a list format. Click each to see information - including bean name, origin, roast level, flavor description, price per pound, and quantity.  A sell method changes the quantity -1 each time a bag is sold. At any time, you can edit the information within the coffee bean type, or delete the whole object altogether from the log.
